p. Step in a list. The zem_nth plugin adds a conditional tag to "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com, which can be used to matches every nth item in a group of items based on the given step and group of. This tag works similarly to the ":nth-child":https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:nth-child pseudo-selector found in CSS.

h2. Installing

p. Using "Composer":http://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer.phar require rah/zem_nth

h2. Tag attributes

bc. <txp:zem_nth step="1" of="3">
	...every third...
<txp:else />
	...first and second...
</txp:zem_nth>

p. Attributes are as follows:

p. *step*
The step to jump.
Example: @step="2"@ Default: @"2"@

p. *of*
Step of how many.
Example: @off="4"@ Default: @undefined@

p. *id*
The identifier assigned to the counter. By default counters are identified by their contents. If you need multiple counters for identical code blocks, you can use the @id@ attribute to set your own identifier to prevent collisions. The @id@ attribute can also be used to connect two counters with different contents that wouldn't normally be connected.
Example: @id="article_sidebar_stripes"@ Default: @undefined@

p. *start*
The value the counter starts from. This allows resuming a previous counter, or just to add padding.
Example: @start="25"@ Default: @"0"@

p. *reset*
If set to @1@, resets the current counter back to the starting value.
Example: @reset="1"@ Default: @"0"@
